Contribution:
My responsibility of the project was to develop authentication, user profile management and the display functionality of the specific user’s past orders. The authentication basically includes two user interfaces: signup and sign in which supports secure password management (Hashing) and session management. The Profile management basically allows the user to view his original details and update them if needed. This section additionally allows the user to insert a display name, shipping address and a billing address. The update password also works with basic functionality like old password verification, re-enter new password etc.

Contribution:
As part of my work on our e-commerce application, I've taken on the task of creating the frontend and backend elements of the Shop page. This involves making sure that the user interface is aesthetically pleasing and responsive and putting in place the backend features required to enable product browsing, selection, and purchase. I've also put a lot of work into designing the admin section's front end, giving administrators a user-friendly interface for effectively managing orders, goods, and user accounts. Currently, I'm actively engaged in the development of the backend functionalities for the Admin section, working on implementing features such as product management, order processing, and user account management to empower administrators with comprehensive control over the e-commerce platform.

Contribution: 
A flawless user experience was my main responsibility while developing our e-commerce application through a variety of capabilities. As part of this, the breadcrumb feature was designed and integrated to implement the application's navigation structure and make it simple for users to navigate between different areas. By creating the Contact Us page and including vital details like the store's location, phone number, and email support, I also helped to increase user engagement and confidence. Moreover, I played a pivotal role in creating a compelling About Us section, crafting captivating content to communicate our brand identity and values effectively.
